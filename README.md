# Problem Statement: Real-Time Detection of AI-Generated Human Speech in Real-World Conversations

The goal of this project is to detect AI-generated human speech and explore deepfake detection approaches that are capable of operating in real-time or near real-time on real conversations.



#  Model Selection Goal: Top 3 Forgery Detection Approaches for Momenta

The goal is to identify the top 3 audio deepfake detection models that best meet Momentaâ€™s core requirements:

 - High Accuracy in Detecting AI-Generated Speech : 
Must handle various deepfake types (TTS, VC) with strong robustness.

- Real-Time or Near Real-Time Capability : 
Fast inference and low computational overhead for live use.

- Robustness in Real Conversations
Effective in noisy, real-world environments across diverse audio sources.
