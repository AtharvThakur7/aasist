## üß© Challenges Encountered & Solutions

| **Challenge**             | **Description**                                                                 | **How It Was Addressed**                                                                 |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Slow Training**         | Full training epochs were too time-consuming for testing/tuning.               | Reduced `num_epochs` to 4 and enabled `torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark` for faster training. |
| **Unclear Defaults**      | Flags like `eval_all_best` and `freq_aug` were missing in some configs.        | Added fallback logic with safe defaults (`True`, `False`) for robustness.                |
| **GPU Dependency**        | The original script assumed CUDA availability.                                 | Introduced device check with fallback to CPU, including warning messages and safe exit.  |
| **Evaluation Delay**      | Evaluation was slow and only useful after meaningful training.                 | Delayed evaluation to run only after best-dev checkpoints were found.                    |
| **Reproducibility**       | Randomness in data loading made it difficult to compare experiment runs.       | Used `torch.Generator`, `seed_worker`, and fixed random seeds for consistency.           |
| **Model Save Management** | Needed to separate best and final model checkpoints.                           | Saved models per epoch, `best-dev`, SWA-averaged, and `best-eval` with clear tags.       |
| **Metric Tracking**       | No persistent way to track loss or EER across epochs.                          | Used TensorBoard and flat file logs (`metric_log.txt`, `t-DCF_EER.txt`).                 |




## Assumptions Made

- Epoch count was kept low (e.g., 3) to reduce runtime under constraints
- Dataset is assumed to be pre-downloaded and correctly structured
- Pretrained weights not used; trained from scratch
- SWA is used selectively when updates are made
- Real-time system not required for this phase

## üîç Model Analysis: AASIST

### Why We Selected AASIST for Implementation ? 

AASIST was selected after a careful evaluation of multiple state-of-the-art models due to its ideal alignment with our primary goals:

- Detecting AI-generated human speech with high accuracy (EER = 0.83%)
- Supporting real-time or near real-time detection, striking a balance between speed and accuracy
- Performing well on real-world conversations, showing resilience to noise, microphone variations, and longer speech sequences

Compared to other models, AASIST offers the best trade-off between performance, generalizability, and practical deployment readiness. It does not overfit to specific attack types and works well even in unseen conditions, which is critical in an evolving threat landscape.

### How AASIST Works (High-Level Overview) : 

- AASIST (Audio Anti-Spoofing using Integrated Spectro-Temporal Graph Attention Networks) is built around a few key technical innovations:
- Spectro-Temporal Feature Modeling: Combines both spectral (frequency) and temporal (time) characteristics of audio to detect subtle artifacts in deepfakes.
- Graph Attention Networks (GATs): Learns relationships between time-frequency regions in the audio spectrogram, allowing the model to understand both global structure and local anomalies.
- Sinc-Convolutional Filters: Automatically learn meaningful frequency representations, replacing hand-crafted features like MFCCs, and improving robustness across data sources.
- Graph Convolution & Attention Layers: These help the model capture long-range dependencies, making it highly adaptable to varied acoustic scenarios.

- Integration Complexity: AASIST relies on custom modules (e.g., GAT, multi-branch CNNs, attention pooling), which required careful model initialization and consistent data formatting.
- Evaluation Logic: Matching trial files with predictions during evaluation was non-trivial due to ID/sort mismatches ‚Äî required careful assertion handling.
- Balancing Performance vs. Speed: With fewer epochs, training was faster but results were less optimized. We had to trade some performance for runtime efficiency.


#### Q2: How might this approach perform in real-world conditions vs. research datasets?


| **Aspect**         | **Research Setting**                                  | **Real World**                                         |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Quality**   | Clean, labeled, balanced.                              | Noisy, unlabeled, highly imbalanced.                   |
| **Attacks**        | Known types with fixed protocols.                      | Unknown, evolving, adversarial methods.                |
| **Latency Constraints** | None.                                              | Must respond in real-time.                             |
| **Performance**    | High EER/tDCF gains.                                   | Likely degradation without adaptation (data drift).    |


#### Q3: What additional data or resources would improve performance?
- More Diverse Spoof Attacks: Training on ASVspoof2021 or real-world deepfake audio samples.
- Labeled Noisy Data: Including real-world distortions, background noise, or microphone artifacts.
- Larger Batch Sizes: Leveraging high-memory GPUs (e.g., A100) for better gradient stability.
- Advanced Data Augmentation: Time stretching, pitch shifting, and synthetic augmentation.
- Semi-supervised Learning: Use unlabeled real-world audio to fine-tune the model post-deployment.
  
#### Q4: How would you approach deploying this model in a production environment?
To deploy the AASIST model in a production environment, Docker provides a reliable, reproducible, and portable solution. Here's the approach:
##### Docker-Based Deployment Strategy
**Containerization**:
- Package the entire application, including the trained model, dependencies, and inference script, into a Docker container using a Dockerfile.

**Environment Isolation**: 
- Ensure the container includes all Python dependencies (e.g., PyTorch, torchaudio, NumPy) to avoid system conflicts. This guarantees the same environment across dev, test, and production.

**Model Inference API**: 
- Expose the model through a lightweight REST API using FastAPI or Flask within the container. This allows clients to send audio inputs and receive spoofing detection results.

**Volume Mounting / Model Storage**
- Store the trained .pth model separately and mount it at runtime (or bake it into the image). This makes version management and updates easier.

**Scalability & Orchestration**:
- Deploy the container using orchestration tools like Docker Compose, Kubernetes, or AWS ECS to handle multiple requests, load balancing, and horizontal scaling.
